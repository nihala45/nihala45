## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm curious about how software works behind the scenes and enjoy solving real-world problems.  
I love learning new things, exploring different technologies, and staying up to date with the latest in tech.  

Being part of tech communities and discussions helps me grow and share what I learn along the way.
